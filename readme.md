Simple multiplayer TicTacToe game, based on React and SocketIO. This is a new version, based on [Javascript stack](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch), partially.
Old version is [here](https://github.com/IgorKonovalov/Tic_Tac_Toe)
For a while it's playable, you [can try it](https://konovalov-tictactoe.herokuapp.com/)
The game is multiplayer - you need an opponent.
First - login with name (it'll be used in chat later), then click on create room, and send four-digits code to your opponent - he'll need it to join you.
